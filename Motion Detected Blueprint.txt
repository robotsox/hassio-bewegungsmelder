  name: Motion-activated Light with illuminance, nightmode and dimmable
  description: Turn on a light when motion is detected and illuminance is below a
    set Lux level. The light will dim before it is turned off to signal that it has
    not detected motion in quite a while. There is also two timers, on for daytime
    and one for nighttime.
